#Git Training Repo

The purpose of this repo is to introduce new trainees to use Git in web development that touches lightly on jQuery and HTML (not to train trainees on web development specifically) An instructor with web development experience is strongly recommended.

##Structure
- **master** branch: for the trainees to work on the assignments
- **gh-pages** branch: for the trainees to know what to expect

##Problems
There are 2 tasks for the trainees.

Task 1: Intended for those with more experience in web development as it requires more manipulation of CSS and very lightly on jQuery.

Task 2: Intended for those with limited experience in web development and also lightly on jQuery.

##Intended Use
An instructor with experience in Git and moderate experience with HTML, CSS, and jQuery would lead the exercise.

A task will be assigned to each trainee as dependent on their level of experience. They will be cloning this repo, creating new branches, committing, and making a pull request on Github.
